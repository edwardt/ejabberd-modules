mod_spark_log_chat 
Transform the Jabber Server in an openid provider.
(http://openid.net/)

Author: 

Motivation:
This is a custom plugin that logs all the chat messages from users and publish such to rabbitmq server, as "topic". This can be sued just for chat archiving or do some "screening" or some other workflow afterwards; for example other consumers can subscribe from those topics, do some processing then republish to other topics or jsut send those to other service to consume.

Status:
This is custom plugin outside of XEP standard.

How it works:
Add in your ejabberd.cfg
{mod_spark_log_chat,  [
		   {format, text},
		   {idMap,[ {..custom data ..}
		    ]}
		]},

TODO:
* it is better to completely seperate custom workflow and custom code into seperate "pluggable module". Chat message extraction and publishing can be reused.

* write common_test for this.
